# Netflix Titles Dataset - Data Cleaning Summary

## Objective
The goal was to clean and preprocess the raw Netflix Titles dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and ensuring consistency.

## Steps Taken

1. **Handled Missing Values**:
   - Identified missing values using `.isnull()`.
   - Retained missing values for `director`, `cast`, and `country` fields where data might genuinely be unavailable.

2. **Removed Duplicates**:
   - Removed duplicate rows using `.drop_duplicates()`.

3. **Standardized Text Formats**:
   - Stripped extra spaces and standardized casing (e.g., `country` and `type` columns were title-cased).

4. **Date Formatting**:
   - Converted `date_added` to a consistent `datetime` format (`yyyy-mm-dd`).

5. **Column Header Formatting**:
   - Renamed all column headers to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores for uniformity.

6. **Data Types Check**:
   - Ensured appropriate data types for each column (e.g., `release_year` as integer, `date_added` as datetime).

## Deliverables
- **netflix_titles_cleaned.csv**: The cleaned and processed dataset.
